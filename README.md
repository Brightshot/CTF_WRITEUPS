## CTF PLATFORMS
##### list might increase in the future, but these are what I'm using currently

## [PICOCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/)
Free CTF platform for beginners to learn about CTFs and how to solve them.
Targeted mostly at high school  and college students

## [TRY HACK ME](https://www.tryhackme.com)
A platform for learning cybersecurity in general, teaches the basics from pre-security basics such as networking, operating systems, web, and so on.
Some resources are free, but complete learning pathways and some challenges require a subscription.

## [HACK THE BOX](https://www.hackthebox.com/)
HTB, similar to THM, is a platform for learning cybersecurity. Unlike THM, its services are separated into different sites (but still use the same login)

[Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) For learning cybersecurity with structured pathways

[Labs & Challenges](https://app.hackthebox.com) for practising studied material

[CTFs](https://ctf.hackthebox.com/) for hacking competitions

Like THM, it's a paid service with different services having separate subscription plans

## [PWN.COLLEGE](https://pwn.college/) 
An amazing site for learning about cybersecurity that teaches from the absolute basics, it's completely free and focuses mainly on offensive security with hundreds of challenges and CTF resources from many other sites.
